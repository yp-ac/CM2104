    <p><b>Web design</b> <em>encompasses</em> many different skills 
    and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.
    The different areas of web design include web graphic design; 
    user interface design (<i>UI design</i>); authoring, including 
    standardised code and proprietary software; user experience 
    design (<i>UX design</i>); and <abbr title="search engine optimization">SEO</abbr>.</p> 

    <p>Often many individuals will work in teams covering different 
    aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover 
    them all. The term <q>web design</q> is normally used to describe 
    the design process relating to the front-end (<i>client side</i>) 
    design of a website including writing markup. Web design 
    partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web 
    development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of 
    usability and if their role involves creating markup then they 
    are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility 
    guidelines.</p>
